RIBO is a Bengali speaking social humanoid robot that can speak, interact with humans, make facial gestures, handshake and dance. It is being developed by a group: RoboSUST, formed with students from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology. RIBO is currently under research and development. Initially it was made as a project funded by Bangladesh Science Fiction Society and Ministry of ICT, Bangladesh. RIBO v1.0 has only movements in the upper torso. RIBO team plans to develop the robot further and give it proper movements in the legs, so that RIBO can be more socially interact with mass population and aid them in need.
