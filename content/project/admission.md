Shahjalal University of Science & Technology, Bangladesh has introduced an SMS based automated registration system for admission tests. Candidates are required to send in their HSC information from any Teletalk prepaid mobile phone. Their information is then processed and verified by the Education Board. After this is completed successfully, the eligible candidates are sent a confirmation message on their mobiles instantly.Finally, the application fee for the admission test is deducted from the candidateâ€™s prepaid mobile account and a notification is sent, again through the SMS channel. All the candidates also receive the admission test seat number via SMS. On the day of the test, the students only need to bring along two attested photographs. The result of the test could again be known using a mobile phone and the students could easily find out their position in merit list.
