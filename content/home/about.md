# Biography

I am Ruhul Amin, a graduate student in Computer Science Department at Stony Brook University (SBU). I have been very fortunate to be supervised by [Professor Steven Skiena](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/). As a graduate research assistant in the [Institute of Advanced Computational Science](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/), I am leading multiple collaborative research works in Bioinformatics and Social Science. During my internship at Amazon AWS AI Algorithms group, I developed deep learning based anomaly detection algorithms. Finally, I still lead a small research group in [Bengali Natural Language Processing](http://nlp.sust.edu/home) in at [Shahjalal University of Science and Technology](https://www.sust.edu/d/cse/faculty/4), Bangladesh. You can contact me at [moamin@cs.stonybrook.edu](mailto:moamin@cs.stonybrook.edu).
