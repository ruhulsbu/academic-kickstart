abstract = "In developing countries such as Bangladesh, social and economic development is often hindered by lack of civilian safety due to increasing crime rate. In this paper, we have attempted to devise a solution to help citizens avoid potentially dangerous locations using data analytics. We designed and developed a system named “Sachetan”, which is a mobile application that enables its users to privately share their own experience of incident occurrences with precise spatial and temporal information. Two data sources are combined and statistical insight and graphical representation of patterns have been presented to the users. In our research, we tried to find the pattern and determine the movements of high-frequency incident areas by analyzing the data."

# abstract_short = "Genome annotation is the process of labeling DNA sequences of an organism with its biological features, and is one of the fundamental problems in Bioinformatics. In this paper, we evaluate DNA K-mer embeddings and the application of RNNs for genome annotation. We show how to improve the performance of our deep networks by incorporating intermediate objectives and downstream algorithms to achieve better accuracy."
