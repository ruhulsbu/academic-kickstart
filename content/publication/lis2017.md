abstract = "Due to the geographic location of Bangladesh, heavy rainfall with the thunderstorm is a common phenomenon. Every year lightning causes lots of casualties. There are very few sources available for lightning-related information. Global Hydrology Resource Centre (GHRC) has a huge collection of lightning data from 1998 to April 2015. The other source of lightning is the news incidents published in Newspapers. This paper explores the effects of lightning in Bangladesh during the last several years, by analyzing lightning news from newspapers and Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) data from Global Hydrology Resource Center (GHRC). We analyzed LIS data and news data to find the correlation between these datasets. Finally, we report lightning-prone areas with time when lightning mostly occurs in Bangladesh based on those results."

# abstract_short = "Genome annotation is the process of labeling DNA sequences of an organism with its biological features, and is one of the fundamental problems in Bioinformatics. In this paper, we evaluate DNA K-mer embeddings and the application of RNNs for genome annotation. We show how to improve the performance of our deep networks by incorporating intermediate objectives and downstream algorithms to achieve better accuracy."
