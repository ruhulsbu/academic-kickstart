# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "This discussion focuses on the sorting algorithm for Bengali language represented by Unicode character set. A few works has been done on this topics but no standard is set up yet to sort Bengali words. Some of these works are based on ASCII representation. To use ASCII, keyboard mapping is important because it is different for each country where the Unicode representation is fixed for all characters of various countries. So, Unicode representation is much more preferable than ASCII representation. In this paper we have discussed about an easy way to sort the Unicode Bengali texts. In our method, a mapping is used which simplified the sorting procedure. This method can sort any Unicode Bengali text and it is not keyboard dependent."

# abstract_short = "Genome annotation is the process of labeling DNA sequences of an organism with its biological features, and is one of the fundamental problems in Bioinformatics. In this paper, we evaluate DNA K-mer embeddings and the application of RNNs for genome annotation. We show how to improve the performance of our deep networks by incorporating intermediate objectives and downstream algorithms to achieve better accuracy."
