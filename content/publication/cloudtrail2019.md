abstract = "AWS CloudTrail service records the actions taken by a user, role or AWS service of an AWS account and save those logs in JSON format in an S3 bucket. The logs are rich source of information for all the events occurred in the cloud environment. Events include actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, AWS SDKs and APIs. Thus, the logs can be used for governance, compliance, and operational / risk auditing for the AWS accounts. So, there is a growing interest not only inside the Amazon Research teams but also in the Cloud Community to create deep learning models that can produce insights from the CloudTrail logs. We present “DeepTracker” to solve following problems: 1) distinguish human generated sessions from the machine / scripted sessions; 2) characterize and differentiate between sessions from two different users; and 3) detecting anomalous sessions from the CloudTrail logs."

# abstract_short = "Genome annotation is the process of labeling DNA sequences of an organism with its biological features, and is one of the fundamental problems in Bioinformatics. In this paper, we evaluate DNA K-mer embeddings and the application of RNNs for genome annotation. We show how to improve the performance of our deep networks by incorporating intermediate objectives and downstream algorithms to achieve better accuracy."
