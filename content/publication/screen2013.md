abstract = "Accessibility of computer for visually impaired people is a Challenging task. This paper presents software named Mongol Dip, which provides audio-based interactive interfaces to help people with visual impairments to explore and navigate windows operating system. In this software we have used text to speech technology (TTS) to echo every operation done by the user. Mongol Dip provides the easiest interface that helps the visually impaired people to access computer. Visually impaired people cannot read out Bangla text document via computer because existing software they use to operate computer do not support Bangla text. Bi-lingual (English & Bangla Language) support is the main significant part of our software. Hence the main goal of this software is to assist the people with visual impairments to operate computers and connecting with the digital world using minimum operations and maximum usability using bi-lingual TTS support."

# abstract_short = "Genome annotation is the process of labeling DNA sequences of an organism with its biological features, and is one of the fundamental problems in Bioinformatics. In this paper, we evaluate DNA K-mer embeddings and the application of RNNs for genome annotation. We show how to improve the performance of our deep networks by incorporating intermediate objectives and downstream algorithms to achieve better accuracy."
