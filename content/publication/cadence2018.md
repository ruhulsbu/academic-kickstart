abstract = "Most traditional unsupervised algorithms for anomaly detection do not work for discrete data, specially when the data dimensions have a very high cardinality. An example of such a multi-dimensional, very high-cardinality discrete data set is CloudTrail event logs, where some of the discrete dimensions, such as the account id, are of the order ~1M. Preliminary experiments using Noise-contrastive Estimation (NCE) based anomaly detection for CloudTrail events suggest that NCE is a good technique for anomaly detection in high-cardinality discrete spaces. The proposed technique models the probability mass function over the discrete space via a deep neural network and uses NCE to estimate the probability mass function; events that have low probabilities are flagged as anomalies. In the internship project, we (1) develop a generalized NCE based deep learning algorithms for anomaly detection over discrete data domains; (2) experimentally validate the performance of the deep learning model; and (3) compare its performance to the current state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms."

# abstract_short = "Genome annotation is the process of labeling DNA sequences of an organism with its biological features, and is one of the fundamental problems in Bioinformatics. In this paper, we evaluate DNA K-mer embeddings and the application of RNNs for genome annotation. We show how to improve the performance of our deep networks by incorporating intermediate objectives and downstream algorithms to achieve better accuracy."
